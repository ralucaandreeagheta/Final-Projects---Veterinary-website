			<h1>Services</h1>
			<p>Habitat provides integrative, compassionate care for dogs, cats, rabbits*, pocket pets*, birds* and many other exotic species*.  (* Select veterinarians only)
			</br>
					If you have any questions or concerns about your pet, always visit or call Habitat and ask to speak with one of our vets.</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Acupuncture</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Acupuncture promotes natural healing. It is a safe, painless and effective way to treat a wide variety of medical problems. 
					Thin sterile needles are used to stimulate energies and bloodflow at designated points on the body in order to relieve pain, enhance healing and strengthen the immune system. This natural approach can be used to resolve specific symptoms or enhance overall health.</p>
				<p>Habitat has been successfully using acupuncture to treat:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Musculoskeletal Disorders</li>
						<li>Dermatological Problems</li>
						<li>Pain Management</li>
						<li>Gastrointestinal Disorders</li>
						<li>Respiratory Problems</li>
						<li>Urinary Disorders</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Alternative Therapies</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>“It does not matter whether medicine is old or new, so long as it brings about a cure.” By combining both conventional 
					and alternative pet therapies we will address all aspects of a pet’s life, from physical changes, emotional influences, 
					diet and lifestyle to environmental factors. Habitat proudly offers the following alternative therapies; acupuncture, 
					chiropractic, therapeutic Laser, food therapy and TCVM herbal therapies.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Chiropractic Care</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Animals need chiropractic too! Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation (VOM) is a healing technology that 
					locates areas of the animal’s nervous system that have fallen out of communication. Healing is induced 
					by re-establishing communication. VOM exists in between veterinary medicine and chiropractic care. It 
					uses a hand-held device that is similar to the device used in a popular chiropractic technique called 
					“Activator Methods”, but is not to be confused with that technique. The differences between VOM and 
					chiropractic are significant and distinct. Although similar, the neurology of animals is still different 
					from that of humans!</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Dental Cleanings & Digital Dental Radiology</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Dental disease is one of the most frequently diagnosed problems in companion animals. At Habitat we 
					provide everything from dental disease prevention to comprehensive teeth cleanings. While cleaning 
					your pet’s teeth we also offer digital dental radiography. Radiography is critical for the accurate 
					evaluation of periodontal disease, as 60% of the disease is hidden below the gumline. Our 
					state-of-the-art software allows us to view images immediately with no chemicals, no wasted developing 
					time and fewer retakes.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Digital Radiography</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Radiology is an invaluable tool in assessing animals with all types of diseases. Our digital radiology equipment provides us with a quick and accurate method of diagnosing problems, while minimizing exposure to radiation. 
					Most patients won’t need any sedation and results can be discussed at the time of your appointment.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Full-Service Laboratory</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Diagnosing your pet’s problems and providing a comprehensive treatment plan is our main goal. Our in house laboratory allows us to perform tests quickly and efficiently, lessening the time it takes to diagnose a disease. 
					For more advanced laboratory tests we use West Vet Laboratory, a locally owned and operated veterinary laboratory.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">In-Patient Care</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>In-patient hospital care for acute injuries and illness: When your pet requires more advanced treatments such as intravenous fluids, IV medications or monitoring our staff can help nurse your pet back to health. While we are not a 24hr emergency care facility, we do routinely see acute injuries and illness that we are happy 
					to schedule for treatment as soon as possible.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Internal Medicine</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>In veterinary medicine, better care begins by listening to your clients. At Habitat we cannot stress how important you are in providing us with a history of how your pet is acting at home. With these clues and a thorough physical exam we can discuss prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. We are here to help 
					provide you with the tools you need to help your pet feel better.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Pharmaceutical, Herbal, Supplements, Vitamins</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Pharmaceutical medications, herbal medications, supplements and vitamins. 
					Habitat has a complete pharmacy available to provide your pet with a variety of treatment option.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Nutritional Consultation</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Feeding an optimal diet will prevent many health problems in your companion and the best way to ensure that they live a long and healthy life. Skin and ear disease as well as more serious conditions such as metabolic diseases, arthritis and obesity can be controlled through proper nutrition. Habitat offers a variety of all natural premium diets, 
					treats and whole food supplements providing the essential ingredients for the optimal health of your companion.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Senior Care</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Finding a balanced wellness plan for your pet will allow them to live a long and healthy life.  We routinely consult clients with senior pets on diet, exercise, behavior changes and quality of life. Using an integrative approach we keep senior animals living longer than ever! When it’s time to make the hard decision to let your pet go we are available to talk you through the process and make sure they are as 
					comfortable as possible in their last days. For this reason we do offer euthanasia as an end of life choice.</p>
